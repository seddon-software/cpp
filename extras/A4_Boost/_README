To setup Boost in Eclipse you need to:

1) Set path and symbols to include directory
2) Set path and symbols to library directory

MACOS prefers to use dynamic link libraries and these are near impossible to
run from Eclipse (each exe has to have DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH set up).  So I use
static linking.  For this to work I have to put the statically linked Boost
libraries in a different folder, otherwise MAC dynamically links.  Look at
the Boost build directory and notice the folder "static".  I ran

    mkdir static
    mv *.a static
    
to get static linking working.

To launch executables you have to add an entry to EACH executable's run configuration:
	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/seddon/work/boost_1_57_0/stage/lib
You can set this up as an exported environment file on the command line, but it doesn't
work in Eclipse.
