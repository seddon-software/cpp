There has been a 10% drop in the number of people from England applying to study in the UK when 
higher fees start, figures show.  The university admissions service, Ucas, says 46,413 fewer 
students from England have applied than at the same time last year.  The government said people 
still saw university as a good investment.  The UCU academics' union said the figures highlighted 
the recklessness of raising fees to £9,000.  Anyone wishing to apply after 30 June will have to 
do so through clearing.
