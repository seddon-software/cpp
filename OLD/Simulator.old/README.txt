This Simulator was written by Tony Bamford in the 1990s for DOS.

To run the simulator, first run
    dosbox

and this will fire up a DOS simulator.  Next mount the current directory as
the C drive and change to this drive:
    mount C .

then check the files available:
    C:dir

The simulator is called 
    PAM.EXE

and all the examples have a .PAM extension.  To run an example type
    PAM <example>.PAM

for example:
    PAM OBO.PAM
